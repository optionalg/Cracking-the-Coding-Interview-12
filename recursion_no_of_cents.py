# Given an infinite number of quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents) and pennies (1 cent), write code to calculate the number of ways of representing n cents.

# working ->
# get how many times the max can divide the number
# create that many paths: e.g with 1 25, 2 25, 3, 25, 0 25
# count these number of paths
